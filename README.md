# keyboard-setup
Store all sorts of keyboard configs I have. I like my emacs bindings, and I like it everywhere!

# Karabiner
Place the file in `~/.config/karabiner`

It enables emacs-like keybindings for google docs etc.

# DefaultKeyBinding.dict Place in
`~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`. It does not work well
for some reason. Some shortcuts such as `alt-f` simply did not work in
apps like google docs etc. I used Karabiner to solve that
